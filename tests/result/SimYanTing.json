    "summary": "I\u2019ve always wanted to be a storyteller. As a kid, I often found myself enthralled by the worlds and wonders writers could conjure simply through the power of the written word. Great storytellers could make us laugh, break our hearts, change our minds \u2013 all without wasting a single word.  I started my career out exploring the power of storytelling through the written word, first at Singapore Press Holdings as a freelance reporter and later on at Vulcan Post delving into all-things-tech. It was only when I started working with brands and merchants that I discovered another secret of storytelling. Great stories sell. I started helping small merchants and startups like Sugar Technologies to sell their ideas through stories that strategically address the needs of their business partners or end users. I then went on to join the product marketing team at Tech in Asia, using the power of storytelling to attract jobseekers to our new Jobs platform. As my role evolved within the startup, I learnt that storytelling alone can be a great asset, but combine that with data, and something magical happens: great insight into the minds of the users. This kicked off my journey as a Growth Product Manager, and I now straddle marketing and product management to listen and empathise with users in order to create the most valuable version of the product for them. I would someday love to use these skills to create useful, intuitive, and beautiful products that will make the world a better place to live in. While I am not out telling great stories, I can usually be found wandering in back alleys making visual stories on Instagram @mishsellsseashells, or soaking in wisdom from the likes of Sylvia Plath, Roald Dahl, and occasionally, Taylor Swift.
